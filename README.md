(wip) better inventory manager for valorant

# Installation/Usage

### 1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-inventory-manager/releases/latest)
It is recommended that you use the [latest release](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-inventory-manager/releases/latest) as compatibility is continously phased out for old versions as development continues.

### 2. Run VIM.exe
As long as `VIM.exe` is running, the randomizer/other features will remain running. **The website does not always need to be open for VIM to work.** Since VIM is packaged into a single file and requires no installer, it is recommended that you move the executable from the downloads folder to a more accessible location, like your taskbar or desktop.

### 3. Open the web client
Open https://colinhartigan.github.io/valorant-inventory-manager/ to interact with VIM! You can set favorite skins, manage the randomizer, and change other settings from there.
